This guide was created by Gram Koski and Francisco Gutierrez for Spring 2025 UCSD CSE145/CSE237D. A project class whose information you can find [here](https://kastner.ucsd.edu/ryan/cse145/). 

New computer accelerators have emerged for ML tasks, and has created a demand for programmers to efficiently use this new hardware. AMD AI Engines (AIE) are novel network-on-chip architecture for processing custom AI Workloads. As a novel architecture, programmers have difficulty implementing optimized designs and fully utilizing its capabilities. We research the space of programming on a AIE and record our findings by creating a well documented ReadTheDocs with examples, guides, and explanations for future AIE programmers. We find the space to be lacking in examples and clear direction, as well as sprinkled with a few documentation/marketing errors.


**Code available** in the [Project 1 Repo](https://github.com/zhenghuama/aie4ml_project1)

In the code you will find scattered examples and projects. For this reason, we also provide exported projects in the wiki. For the end of every module, these projects can be dowloaded and imported into Vitis. This creates a better workflow to test than the manual method of creating the file structure and editing files. This is especially important since Vitis has changed and can possibly change their project's file structure.

**Read The Docs** page available at [Making AIE Dev Easier](https://making-aie-dev-easier-readthedocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
The Read The Docs page goes through module examples. But also talks about the architecture, motivations, design space, and tooling. This gives the guide a good walkthrough for beginners.
